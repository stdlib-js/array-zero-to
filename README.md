    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import zeroTo from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-zero-to@deno/mod.js';
```

#### zeroTo( n\[, dtype] )

Generates a linearly spaced numeric array whose elements increment by `1` starting from zero.

```javascript
var arr = zeroTo( 5 );
// returns <Float64Array>[ 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ]
```

If `n == 0`, the function returns an empty array.

```javascript
var arr = zeroTo( 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>[]
```

The function recognizes the following data types:

-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers (IEEE 754)
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers
-   `int32`: 32-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integers
-   `int16`: 16-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integers
-   `int8`: 8-bit two's complement signed integers
-   `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integers
-   `uint8c`: 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to `0-255`
-   `generic`: generic JavaScript values

By default, the output array data type is `float64` (i.e., a [typed array][mdn-typed-array]). To specify an alternative data type, provide a `dtype` argument.

```javascript
var arr = zeroTo( 5, 'int32' );
// returns <Int32Array>[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

## Notes

-   For complex number arrays, each element of the returned array has an imaginary component equal to `0`.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import sort2hp from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/blas-ext-base-gsort2hp@deno/mod.js';
import discreteUniform from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-array-discrete-uniform@deno/mod.js';
import zeroTo from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-zero-to@deno/mod.js';

// Generate an array of random numbers:
var opts = {
    'dtype': 'generic'
};
var x = discreteUniform( 10, 100, 200, opts );

// Generate an array of indices:
var idx = zeroTo( x.length, opts.dtype );

// Create a temporary array to avoid mutation:
var tmp = x.slice();

// Sort the index array according to the sort order of `x`:
sort2hp( x.length, 1, tmp, 1, idx, 1 );

console.log( x );
console.log( idx );
